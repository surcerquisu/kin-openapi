Comunicacion Serial Pic A Pic Mikroc is a method of serial communication between two PIC microcontrollers using the UART module and a Bluetooth module. UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter and it is a serial communication interface that allows data transfer between devices. Bluetooth is a wireless technology that enables data exchange over short distances.

In this article, we will learn how to use Comunicacion Serial Pic A Pic Mikroc to send and receive data between two PIC microcontrollers via Bluetooth. We will use the MikroC for PIC compiler and the Proteus software for simulation. We will also need two Bluetooth modules, such as HC-05 or HC-06, and two PIC microcontrollers, such as PIC16F877A or PIC18F4550.
 
## Hardware Setup
 
The hardware setup for Comunicacion Serial Pic A Pic Mikroc is shown in the figure below. We need to connect the TX pin of one PIC microcontroller to the RX pin of one Bluetooth module, and the RX pin of the same PIC microcontroller to the TX pin of the same Bluetooth module. Similarly, we need to connect the TX pin of the other PIC microcontroller to the RX pin of the other Bluetooth module, and the RX pin of the other PIC microcontroller to the TX pin of the other Bluetooth module. We also need to connect the VCC and GND pins of both Bluetooth modules to a 5V power supply.

## Software Setup
 
The software setup for Comunicacion Serial Pic A Pic Mikroc involves writing two programs: one for the transmitter PIC microcontroller and one for the receiver PIC microcontroller. The transmitter program will send a string of characters to the receiver program via Bluetooth, and the receiver program will display the received string on an LCD screen.
 
The transmitter program is shown below. It uses the UART library of MikroC for PIC to initialize the UART module with a baud rate of 9600 bps, and then sends a string "Hello World!" using the UART\_Write\_Text function. It also uses a delay function to wait for 1 second before sending the string again.
 `
#include "UART.h"

void main() 
  UART1_Init(9600); // Initialize UART module with 9600 bps
  Delay_ms(100); // Wait for UART module to stabilize

  while (1)  // Endless loop
    UART1_Write_Text("Hello World!"); // Send string via UART
    Delay_ms(1000); // Wait for 1 second

` 
The receiver program is shown below. It also uses the UART library of MikroC for PIC to initialize the UART module with a baud rate of 9600 bps, and then declares a character array to store the received string. It also uses the LCD library of MikroC for PIC to initialize an LCD screen with 16 columns and 2 rows, and then displays a message "Waiting..." on it. It then uses a while loop to check if there is any data available on the UART buffer using the UART\_Data\_Ready function, and if so, it reads the data using the UART\_Read\_Text function and stores it in the character array. It then displays the received string on the LCD screen using the Lcd\_Out function.
 `
#include "UART.h"
#include "LCD.h"

char txt[16]; // Declare character array

void main() {
  UART1_Init(9600); // Initialize UART module with 9600 bps
  Delay_ms(100); // Wait for UART module to stabilize

  Lcd_Init(); // Initialize LCD
  Lcd_Cmd(_LCD_CLEAR); // Clear LCD
  Lcd_Cmd(_LCD_CURSOR_OFF); // Turn off cursor
  Lcd_Out(1,1,"Waiting..."); // Display message on LCD

  while (1) { // Endless loop
    if (UART_Data_Ready()) { // Check if data is available on UART buffer
      UART_Read_Text(txt,"!",15); // Read data until '!' character or 15 characters
      Lcd_Out(2,1,txt); // Display received
